### Simple Test with React + Firebase Auth

I create this project to test connection and learning how firebase works.
It's easly to connect with you know useState and arrow funtion of React.

    login -> if change the useState of login will be replaced
    password -> if change the useState of password will be replaced

    button -> onClick( Call function )

With this simple logic the handle function call `signInWithEmailAndPassword` and in async function will be works.
